_"Surf" through word-relatedness in wide-eyed amazement!_  
_Astonish your friends, scare your neighbors, earn the respect of your spouse!_

## Getting started
You'll need gensim, pygame installed and of course a dataset. If you're already there, simply:  
`git clone https://github.com/rocket-pig/vector-visualizer`\
`cd vector-visualizer`\
open main.py and set the proper location of your .vec file.
run with\
`python main.py 'seed'`\
...once loaded, ***use the keyboard arrow keys*** to surf! ie, 
pressing left will bring the word to the left to the center. You'll be in word-heaven in no time.  



## Getting a dataset
the one shown above is the wikipedia word vector dataset: (104MB download, 280MB unzipped)  
[wiki.simple.vec.zip](https://darknesseverytime.live/mirror/wiki.simple.vec.zip)  
or mirror [wiki.simple.vec.zip](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1u79f3d2PkmePzyKgubkbxOjeaZCJgCrt&export=download)  
...you're of course free to plug any .vec file into this. If you use other ones, I'd love to see/hear about the results!

## Installing gensim:
`pip install -U gensim`\
or visit their [github](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim) for more.
